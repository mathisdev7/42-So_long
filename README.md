## Project Description

The `so_long` project is a 2D game developed as part of the 42 School curriculum. It involves creating a simple game where the player navigates through a map, collects items, and reaches the exit. This project emphasizes game development principles, including graphics rendering, user input handling, and memory management in C.

## Journey

This project presented a significant challenge, requiring multiple iterations to achieve a functional game. My initial attempts were hindered by issues with map loading and player movement. However, through persistent debugging and testing, I was able to refine my implementation and create a playable game.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding game development concepts and principles
- Implementing graphics rendering using the MinilibX library
- Handling user input for player movement and interactions
- Memory management and dynamic memory allocation in C
- Debugging and optimizing game performance

## Technical Details

- The game utilizes the MinilibX library for graphics rendering.
- Key features include:
  - A player character that can move around the map.
  - Collectible items that the player can gather.
  - An exit point that the player must reach to complete the game.
- The game map is defined in a `.ber` file format, which is read and parsed at runtime.

## Project Status

- **First Attempt**: Success (Fully Functional Game)
- **Completion Time**: ~7 days

## Challenges Faced

The most challenging aspects of this project included:

- Designing a functional and engaging game map
- Implementing player movement and collision detection
- Debugging issues related to memory leaks and resource management
- Ensuring smooth graphics rendering and user interactions

## Reflection

While this project was one of the more complex ones at 42, it significantly enhanced my understanding of game development and graphics programming. The iterative process of refining my approach taught me the importance of thorough testing and debugging in creating a smooth gaming experience.

## Skills Developed

- Game development principles
- Graphics rendering using MinilibX
- User input handling
- Memory management
- Debugging and performance optimization
